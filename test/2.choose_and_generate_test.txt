# 测试能否让模型选择更好的prompt——放弃，这个prompt有点太长太难改
# 第一个测试，测试选择Text2SQL的prompt效果选择

Some prompts are given below. It is provided in a numbered list (1 to 2), where each item in the list corresponds to a TEXT2SQL generate task.
---------------------\n
1. """ Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer. 
You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.

Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a few relevant columns given the question.

Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema description. 
Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Pay attention to which column is in which table. Also, qualify column names with the table name when needed. You are required to use the following format, each taking one line:
    
Question: Question here
SQLQuery: SQL Query to run
SQLResult: Result of the SQLQuery
Answer: Final answer here

Only use tables listed below.
{schema}

Question: {query_str}
SQLQuery: """

IMPORTANT NOTE: you can use specialized pgvector syntax (`<->`) to do nearest \
neighbors/semantic search to a given vector from an embeddings column in the table. \
The embeddings value for a given row typically represents the semantic meaning of that row. \
The vector represents an embedding representation \
of the question, given below. Do NOT fill in the vector values directly, but rather specify a \
`[query_vector]` placeholder. For instance, some select statement examples below \
(the name of the embeddings column is `embedding`):
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[query_vector]' LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM items WHERE embedding <-> '[query_vector]' < 5;

Using only the choices above and not prior knowledge, return the choice that is could performance best to the Task : use LLM generate SQL from Text. \n
Provide choice in the following format: 'ANSWER: <number>' and explain why this summary was selected in relation to the question.

Given the new context, refine the original answer to better "
    "answer the query. "
